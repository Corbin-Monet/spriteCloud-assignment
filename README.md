# The spriteCloud-assignment

## Whats the objective of the project

This is a Cypress Automation project covering both Web-App and API features, this is a framework for e2e testing. The framework is using "mocha-awesome" to generate RICH html reporting, to ensure viewers of the results can easily understand and make their calculated decisions!

## General Info on this project

The project is setup mainly for "local" change to "Dev" push CI | CD. This will ensure high velocity and is, in my opinion, perfect for a "Start-Up" business, as the product is still finding itself and in this quest is changing rapidly. This approach ensures that the product can change rapidly BUT still ensure that there are no breaking changes introduced to Dev. This would not suite a more mature product / business, in my opinion, as there should be more structured CI | CD pipeline. I.E: Integration tests live in AWS / AZURE at the end of the building and deploying, UNIT tests living in the GIT build CI | CD and run locally before code hits Dev branch (As an example)

## How to run these tests

**Setup Local**

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure you are "root"
3. On the command line and type ```yarn``` (ubuntu) or ```npm i```

**Git actions Pipeline**

1. Make your local changes to the product
2. Add , merge your tests - Local branch
3. Ensure your local endPoint / App is started / Running
4. Ensure that the Cypress BaseURL's are pointing to the local server
    - Change these settings in the cypress.config.ts file
    - Example for API:

5. "git push" and the cypress tests will start and run

**Run all the tests on your system**

1. run: ```cd "root"```
2. run: ```npx cypress run```

**Run an individual test on your system**

1. run: ```cd``` "root"
2. run: ```npx cypress run --spec "Path TO File"```
    - Example for this project: ```npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/createUserswagAPI.spec.js"```

**Assignment Section**
1. link to results on Calliope.pro: 
2. One improvement for Calliope.pro
    - As a returning user, hitting the home page for https://www.calliope.pro/ im faced with this page:

      The above makes it incredibly hard to login, I find myself having to hit the "Sign up" button and then hit the "Back to log in"

      To be able to log in again. I would add a "Login" button on the Top Nav bar, next to the "Sign up" button!

3. One new feature for Calliope.pro (I know this could be achieved with API BUT im talking more APP wizard setup, make it seamless)
    - An Integration with "GitHub", there are some cool things that could be done. For instance, I could send the "mocha-test" results directly to Calliope.pro and           then send those results to a "slack integration". This is very apealing to me, I generally am in favor of kicking off a build and not having to watch it the      entire time and or do manual things to get my results! Kick off the CI | CD and then go for a coffee - This is what I aim for ðŸ˜œ
